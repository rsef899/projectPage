             <v-card-text class=""> The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a Reactive Co-Processor (ReCOP) that enhances the performance of control-dominated applications in reactive environments. The ReCOP, specifically engineered for handling asynchronous events and managing real-time responses, will integrate seamlessly with other processors, including a main NIOS processor, to offload reactive tasks to. This co-processor will utilise a specialised Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) similar to RISC, tailored for reactive programming, which includes unique instructions like DATACALL, LSIP, and SSOP. The ReCOP will be connected through a TDMA-MIN Network on Chip (NOC) interface, ensuring effective data communication and synchronisation across various processing units. With tools like Quartus, the ReCOPâ€™s functionality and reliability will be extensively tested under various operational scenarios to ensure each instruction is processed appropriately, as well as to measure the performance of the processor.
